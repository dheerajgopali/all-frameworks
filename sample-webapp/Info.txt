Create a web application manually

All you need is to create the folder structure appropriately
If it is a maven project, make sure to create folder structure as below

src
--main
----webapp
------index.jsp //This is to show the default page when application is accessed
------WEB-INF
--------web.xml //Can contain as simple info as below
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xmlns = "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
   http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
         id = "WebApp_ID" version = "3.0">
    <display-name>User Management</display-name>
</web-app>

After this, go to folder location, execute mvn clean install to create war file and deploy it in any container.
