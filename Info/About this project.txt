How to create remote GIT repository
1.Create a folder with foldername.git extension
2.git init –bare (This creates empty bare repo)

How to create and sync local git repo and push it to remote repo
1.Go to current project
2.git init (Should not use -bare switch. -bare cleans all the existing files)
3.Add the files to commit. Then commit the files (By default everything will go into master branch)
4.Add a normal name to this repo. Easy to identify while pushing changes
5.Push all the changes to the remote repo

Remote repository path (Its a pendrive. Change drive letter if pendrive drive is other than E drive)
E:dev/remote-repos/git/all-frameworks.git

How to clone the repo
git clone E:dev/remote-repos/git/all-frameworks.git
