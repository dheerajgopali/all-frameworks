Frameworks
1.Groovy - a dynamic language similar to Python.
    It can be used as scripting language for java, is dynamicaly compiled to JVM bytecode, and interoperates with other java code and libraries.
->Code is similar to java
->All java code is syntactically valid Groovy, semantics may be different.

2.Grails - open source web application framework, follows 'coding by convention'
    It uses Groovy, hides much of the configuration detail from the developer.

3.Angular JS - a javascript MVC open-source web application framework
    To address challenges in single-page applications. Simplifies both development and testing by framework MVC(model-view-controller) and MVVM(model-view-viewmodel) architectures.
->Used as frontend part in MEAN stack.

4.Node.js - an javascript open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applns.
    It provides an even-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O API that optimizes an appln's throughput and scalability.
->It contains a built-in library to allow applns to act as a webserver without software such as Apache HTTP server, IIS, Nginx.

5.MEAN stack - free and open-source javascript software pack, builds dynamic websites and web applications.
Its a combination of the following
-> MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
-> Express.js, a web applications framework.
-> Angular JS, a javascript MVC framework for web apps,
-> Node.js, a software platform for scalable server-side and networking applns.

6.SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language
Its an XML-based, data format for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider.

Terms
1.Dynamic programming language -
    a language, at runtime, execute many common programming behaviours that static programming languages perform during compilation.
 ->It includes extension of the program, by adding new code, by extending objects and definitions, or by modifying the type system.

2.Coding by convention -
    a design paradigm which seeks to decrease the number of decisions that developers need to make, gaining simplicity, and not necessarily loosing flexibility.
->Simply, a develop only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application.

3.Single-page application -
    A web application or web site that fits on a single web page.
-> The page doesn't reload at any point in the process, not does control transfer to another page.
-> It involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.

4.Internet of Things (IOT) - Internet of Everything, Network of Everything
    It is the network of physical objects or things embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data with the
other connected devices based on a standard infrastructure.
->Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020

5.Ubiquitous computing
    A concept where computing is made to appear everywhere and anywhere. Unlike desktop computing, this can occur using any device, in any location, and in any format.

6.Cloud computing -
    A model to enable ubiquitous network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.
-> It focuses on maximizing the effectiveness of the shared resources.
-> This can work for allocating resources to users. For example, a cloud computer facility that serves European users during European business hours with a specific application (e.g., email)
may reallocate the same resources to serve North American users during North America's business hours with a different application (e.g., a web server).
