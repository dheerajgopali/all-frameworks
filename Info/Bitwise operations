Operations
NOT,complement (~) - 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0
->Logical negation of each bit.
->Equal to two's compliment of a value minus one.



One's complement
Invert 1 to zero and zero to one in a binary number.

Two's complement
Method 1 : Find one's complement of a number and add one.

Q1 : How to generate a negative number given its positive number. If you have a binary number (with 1 in msb), how to find magnitude of that negative number)


~ is only for inverting bits in a number. It wont create either negative number or anything related to the number converted.
If you want to know the magnitude of a negative number, just invert bits and find the magnitude and put negative sign infront of it.

~ can be used in an if condition as below
Without tilde (This method might return only negative number if character not found, i.e. -1)
if (someStr.indexOf("a") >= 0) {
    // Found it
} else  {
    // Not Found
}

With tilde (~-1 is 0, so 0 in a if condition means false. So using tilde here simplifies the code.)
if (~someStr.indexOf("a")) {
    // Found it
} else  {
    // Not Found
}
