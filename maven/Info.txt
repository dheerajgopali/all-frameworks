Repository:
A repository stores two types of artifacts: releases and snapshots.
Release repositories are for stable, static release artifacts(like production network)
Snapshot repositories are frequently updated repositories that store binary software artifacts from projects under constant development (like development/testing network)


The GAV(Group, Artifact, Version coordinate) coordinate standard is the foundation for Maven’s ability to manage dependencies.
Group Identifier (groupId)
A group identifier groups a set of artifacts into a logical group. often reflects organisation. eg : org.apache.maven

Artifact Identifier (artifactId)
An artifact is an identifier for a software component. represent an application or a library. The combination of groupId and artifactId must be unique for a project.
eg : simple-webapp, simple-library

Version (version)
The version of a project follows the established convention of Major, Minor, and Point release versions.
For example, if your simple-library artifact has a Major release version of 1, a minor release version of 2, and point release version of 3,
your version would be 1.2.3. Versions can also have alphanumeric qualifiers which are often used to denote release status.
An example of such a qualifier would be a version like “1.2.3-BETA” where BETA signals a stage of testing meaningful to consumers of a software component.

Packaging (packaging)
Maven was initially created to handle JAR file, but a Maven repository is completely agnostic where it comes to the type of artifact it is managing.
Packaging can be anything that describes any binary software format including ZIP, SWC, SWF, NAR, WAR, EAR, SAR.
