This module is meant for threads topics practice.

Definitions
Race condition:
Spinwait:
    When a thread has to wait for a very little time to get what it wants, instead of leaving the monitor/CPU, it continues
to use it with for loop or something without releasing monitor/CPU. This way the cached data by thread will not be lost.
Otherwise if it releases monitor and reaquires it, it has to get the cached data again which might be time consuming.
